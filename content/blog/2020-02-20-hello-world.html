Welcome to <a href="/">Integer Club</a>.
</p>
<p>
This community was formed to promote discussion and collaboration
between people who love mathematics but are not necessarily
mathematicians. The discussions in this community mostly hover around
mathematics, computer science, and algorithms. If you find these topics
interesting, you are welcome to <a href="/join/">join us</a> and be a
part of our community. You are also welcome to invite your friends and
colleagues and help this community grow.

<p>
Apart from the group mailing list, there are Slack and IRC channels for
the community as well. To learn more about the other channels, please

We have the following goals in mind:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Be a platform where students and professionals of all backgrounds
    can come together to learn and discuss mathematics.
  </li>
  <li>
    Welcome discussion on related areas such as computer science,
    algorithms, cryptography, related software tools such as \( \LaTeX
    \), NumPy, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Discuss mathematical puzzles for fun!
